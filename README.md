This repository is a companion to my progress through "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. The code included is a combination of exercises and examples from the lessons, many of them combined into single programs or otherwise altered to best reinforce the concepts and syntax that I felt would be especially useful to practice.

### Topics by Chapter
- Chapter 1: Overview of core C functionality
- Chapter 2: Data types, operators, precedence
